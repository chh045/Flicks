# Project 1 - *Flicks*

**Flicks** is a movies app using the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: **15** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [✔️] User can view a list of movies currently playing in theaters from The Movie Database.
- [✔️] Poster images are loaded using the UIImageView category in the AFNetworking library.
- [✔️] User sees a loading state while waiting for the movies API.
- [✔️] User can pull to refresh the movie list.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [✔️] User sees an error message when there's a networking error.
- [ ] Movies are displayed using a CollectionView instead of a TableView.
- [✔️] User can search for a movie.
- [ ] All images fade in as they are loading.
- [✔️] Customize the UI.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. UISearchBar delegation provides great convience for programmers to deal with the on tap action of displaying the keyboard and responses. However we are capabale of customizing the way we want with the keyboard by calling the optionals.

2. To prevent optional varibales cause crashes, we can also use "Guard". However the usage of '!' and '?' requires more various examples and practices.
